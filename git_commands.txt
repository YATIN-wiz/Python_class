It facilitates navigating to the desired branch, enabling us to add new files, make changes, and commit those files within that specific branch)
git checkout -b <branchname> (creates a new branch)
git merge <branchname> (should be in the destination branch then merge it with the source code/branch)
git stash (when we want to save our work without staging or committing the code to our Git repository)
git clone (cloning the file into our local computer)
git push (which pushes the commits made to the remote repository )
git pull (which downloads the content from the specified remote repository and then immediately updates the local repo to match the content)
